# Bear Displayer

Use of the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) to make an application that displays beers. For each beer it should display its name, tagline, its year of first brewery and its image.

Each is presented in a rectangle and multiple rectangles are shown on the same line. The application is responsive.
